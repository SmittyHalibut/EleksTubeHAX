## 4. Quick Start - Backup and Pre-Build images

Backup your original firmeware image and use the pre-builded firmware images to start with this custom firmware.

### 4.1 Backup first!!!

**Always backup YOUR clocks firmware version as first step!**

If you mess-up your clock, it's only your fault!

**Note**: **Backup images from other users** normally **DO NOT WORK** as the most original firmware (like from EleksTube) is locked to the MAC address of the ESP32!

For other clocks it MAY work, but don't assume it!
Most clocks have MAC address binding!

So again: Do a backup of your orignal firmware image first!

### 4.2 How to do the backup

#### 1) Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver

##### Windows

- On Windows, plug-in the cable into the clock and connect it to an USB port of your PC. Then run Windows Update. It will find and install the driver and generate an virtual COM port.<br>
Windows device manager COM port example:<br>
![Windows device manager COM port example](/documentation/ImagesMD/WindowsDeviceManagerCOMport.png)
- Only if Windows Update is not working for you, see the chinese manufacturers website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Windows and install them manually.

##### Linux

- On an up-to-date Linux it works out of the box. COM port should be something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
- If it is not working, see this [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/linux) and see the chinese manufacturers website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Linux.

#### 2) Save your original firmware

To read from (or write to) the clock, it needs to be in the "download mode". Most clocks will go into this mode automatically, when the ESPTool tries to read or write to them.
Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable).

##### Windows users:

- In the folder ```pre-built-firmware``` of this repo you have the `esptool.exe`, which is used to talk to the ESP32 in your clock over the USB-Serial chip on the board of the clock.
- Open Device Manager and find out which virtual COM port represents your clock.
- Modify file `_ESP32 save flash 4MB.cmd` with your COM port number.
- Run the CMD file.
- It will generate a file named `backup1.bin`. Rename it and save it to a safe place!
- This is your precious backup!

##### Linux users:

- You probably already know where to get `ESPTool` and how to use it. :)
- If not, this guide from the Tasmota project is very easy to follow: [ESPTool](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Esptool/#put-device-in-firmware-upload-mode)
- Adopt the settings for your connected clock and save the firmware file to your device.

### 4.3 Use the pre-builded firmware images

If you just want to use this firmware without setting up the development tools and libraries and everything, navigate to folder `\pre-built-firmware\` and modify `_ESP32 write flash.cmd` to upload the version for your clock.

More info can be found in the `\pre-built-firmware\` folder in the [README.MD](pre-built-firmware/README.md).
Like:

- Features enabled in the images
- How to get the newest image

If you want more features and configure the firmware, continue reading and check section "How to build this firmware".

### 4.4 Restore backup

You can write back your original firmware by modyfing the file `_ESP32 write flash.cmd`.

- Set correct COM port and the name of your firmware backup file
- If needed, set the size to be written
- Run the CMD file and flash the firmware file
- Check if clock is working

### 4.5 Known backup problems

#### COM port problems

There are a lot of possible issues known with so called "virtual COM ports".
Some common ones are listed below.

- On Windows: No COM port at all, but "unknown device" in the device manager -> Try to install the CH340 drivers manually.
- ESPTool fails to read or write all of the firmware -> Check your cable and if possible try another and a shorter one. Try to reduce the baud rate of the connection (like to 115200 or even below). Try to use an external powered USB hub, to avoid under powering.
- ESPTool is giving an error like "device is not in the download mode" -> Try to hold the power button while plugging the USB-C (power) cable. If this doesn't help, you may have a timing problem with the USB-UART chip. This is known for some combinations of USB controllers (especially 3.x) and the CH340. Try to use a USB2.x HUB with external USB power supply or get another COM-port card. If nothing helps, try to use another computer.

For more info ask your favorite search engine or AI Chatbot :)

### 4.6 Lost firmware file

If you lost your orginal firmware file and wants to restore the orginal firmware you normaly have a problem, because even if you get a backup file from another user, it is locked to the MAC address of the other ESP32 MAC.
Under some conditions, it should be possible to change the encoded MAC address in the firmware. This worked for EleksTube Gen1 clocks. See [Issue 8](https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/EleksTubeHAX/issues/8).

Note: There is no gurantee, that you are able to change the MAC address in the firmware file successfully! If the orginal manufacturer decides to encode the MAC address or hide it, the descriped method will not work!

So remember:
**Always backup your original firmware!**

## 5. How to build this firmware

Unfortunately, it's not simple plug-and-play.

You need to do some things.

These instructions assume you already know how to use the **Visual Studio Code** and the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for it, and just need to know what to do.

### 5.1 Download the code

You're either reading this file after downloading/cloning it already, or you're reading it on GitHub.

If the last point applies, then we assume you can figure out how to get the code from GitHub and put it somewhere on your local machine.

### 5.2 Visual Studio Code & PlatformIO IDE

Follow this guide here: [Install PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

In short:

- Download, install and run VSCode
- Go to Extensions, search for "PlatformIO IDE" and install it (it will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner).
If you don't have Python already installed it will be automatically added by PlatformIO. In case of issues, install Python 3.x manually.

### 5.3 Open the project in Visual Studio Code/PlatformIO

- Start Visual Studio Code (VSC) and select "Open Folder".
- Select the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder from your location of the code of this project.
- PlatformIO (PIO) will detect the `platformio.ini` file and open the project as an PlatformIO project automatically and will download all needed packages/libraries.
- If this is not happening automatilly, go to the PIO tab in VSC and select "Pick a Folder" and select the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder.

#### 5.3.1 ESP32 platform support

The EspressIF 32 development platform for PlatformIO is required to support the ESP32 microcontroller. It will be installed automatically when this project is opened in VSCode/PlatformIO or if the first build is triggered. It will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner.

Tested on version 6.0.9 from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif32).

#### 5.3.2 Build environment

The default environment for this project is using the "board" definition of the orginal "Espressif ESP32 Dev Module" named "esp32dev".

Flash size settings are already configured in the partition table file.

| filename | environment | flash size | app part size | data part size |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `partition_noOta_1Mapp_3Mspiffs.csv` | esp32dev | 4.0 MB | 1.2 MB | 2.8 MB |

No OTA partition, one app partition, one data partition as SPIFFS to store the images of the clock faces.

These files are used by PlatformIO to create the partions on the flash of the ESP32 when uploading.

Upload port is set to 921600 baud in the `platformio.ini` file.

**Note**: Some clocks do not support such high speed, if you have issues, reduce this to 512000 baud or even lower.

#### 5.3.3 Libraries in use

All the listed libraries are in use (see `platformio.ini` file).

The most recent versions are automatically installed from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org) (or the given source location) as soon as the project is opened or before first compilation.

It will take a while to initally install them - observe status messages in build log screen.

Compiles and works fine with listed library versions below, as of 2024-02-03. Newer (or possibly older) versions should be fine too.

If you have issues with automatic installation, here are locations of the original source code.

| ArduinoJson | Benoit Blanchon  | 7.0.2 | https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson.git |
| RTC by Makuna | Michael C.Miller  | 2.4.2 | https://github.com/Makuna/Rtc/wiki |
| SparkFun APDS9960 RGB and Gesture Sensor | SparkFun  | 1.4.3 | https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_APDS-9960_Sensor_Arduino_Library |

**Notes**:
`RTC by Makuna` is only required for "SI HAI clock".

`sparkfun/SparkFun APDS9960 RGB and Gesture Sensor` is only required by NovelLife SE clocks with gesture sensor.

Code from `IPgeolocation` and `NTPclient` libraries were copied into the project and heavily updated (mostly bug fixes and error-catching).

`DS1307RTC` is only available in version "0.0.0-alpha+sha.c2590c0033" from the PlatformIO registry. This version is working and should be compiled from the latest code version in the original repo of the lib. But to have a "nicer" version number (1.4.1), add `https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/DS1307RTC.git#1.4.1` instead of `paulstoffregen/DS1307RTC` into the `platform.ini`.

#### 5.3.4 Configure the `TFT_eSPI` library

The supplied `script_configure_tft_lib.py` automatically takes care of the library configuration. It copies two files (`_USER_DEFINES.h` and `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h`) into the ```TFT_eSPI``` library folder before building. This makes sure, that the TFT_eSPI library is initalized with the correct values for each clock type.

If you have issues with the scripts, copy the files manually every time the `TFT_eSPI` library is updated.

#### 5.3.5 Configure the `APDS9960` library (NovelLife SE)

The supplied `script_adjust_gesture_sensor_lib.py` modifies some files of the APDS9960 library before building. It adds the support for the ID of the used (cloned) gesture chip (needed for NovelLife SE with gesture sensor only).

### 5.4 Configure, Build and Upload new firmware

Make sure you configured everything for your clock in the `_USER_DEFINES.h` in the `src` folder:

- Rename/Copy `_USER_DEFINES - empty.h` to `_USER_DEFINES.h`
- Select the target hardware platform (Elekstube, Elekstube Gen 2, NovelLife, SI_HAI or PunkCyber) by uncommenting the appropriate hardware define (only ONE clock type can be defined at a time, so comment out the unwanted)
- Select if you prefer WPS or hardcoded credentials for WiFi (comment '#define WIFI_USE_WPS' line and enter your WiFi network credentials to the other lines and uncomment them)
- Select image type for the clock faces to store: Bitmap files (.BMP) or .CLK files (uncomment #define USE_CLK_FILES)

Optionally:

- Enable automatic "Night Time Mode" by (uncomment `#define DIMMING` line and also the follwing which defines the begin and end of the night time).
- Enable integrated MQTT service (uncomment `#define MQTT_ENABLED` line and enter your MQTT credentials. From your local broker or from an internet-based broker.
E.g. register on [SmartNest.cz](https://www.smartnest.cz/), create a Thermostat device, copy your username, API key and Thermostat Device ID.
- Use IP-based geolocation by Abstract (uncomment `#define GEOLOCATION_ENABLED` and enter your geolocation API key: Register on [Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/), select Geolocation API and copy your API key.
- Enable Home Assistant (HA) support by uncomment `#define MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` and the following block of comments for Auto-Discovery in HA (MQTT Broker needed! So `MQTT_ENABLED` have to be defined and also setting of a HA compatible broker).

Connect the clock to your computer via a USB cable. You'll see, that a new serial port is detected and showing up in the device configuration. If not, check the section "Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver".

PlatformIO will automatically select the right port for uploading (in most cases).

Most clocks will go into to the download mode automatically, when PlatformIO is trying to upload the builded firmware files.
Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable).

 **Note**: If you have Bluetooth virtual ports on your machine, it might hang and you must manually select the COM port in the `platformio.ini`, see [Upload options](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/upload/index.html).

#### 5.4.1 Step 1 - Compile the code and upload the firmware file (to the app partition)

Compile the code via the "Build" command of PlatformIO extension and upload the code via the "Upload" command in the matching environment for your clock.

![PlatformIO Build](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuild.png)

At this point, it should build cleanly and upload successfully.

Example output from a successfull build:

![PlatfromIO Build Output](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildOutput.png)

Example output from a successfull upload:

![PlatformIO Upload Output](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOUploadOutput.png)

**Note**: On auto-reset clocks, you'll see the clock boot up after upload. It will go into the setup routine and ask for WPS or connecting to the configured WiFi network. On some clocks, you need to to a manual reset (power off/on cylce)

**Note**: After the initally flash, your clock will **NOT SHOW ANYTHING** on the displays after the setup phase!
This is, because it doesn't have any bitmaps to display on the flash memory yet!

**The screens will stay blank until you upload data!**

Continue with the next step to get the clock running.

#### 5.4.2 Step 2 - Fill data partition (SPIFFS) with images

The repository comes with a "predefined" set of BMP files in the `data` subdirectory of the `EleksTubeHAX_pio` folder.

Each set of 10 images (one image for each digit) is called a "clock face" and can be chosen from the clock menu. Each set represents normally a different design or 'font' for the clock.
See below if you want to make your own.

Note: All files in the `data` directory will be packed into the SPIFFS flash image! Make sure to tidy it up regulary.

##### 5.4.2.1 Generate and upload

- In PlatformIO extension go to "Project Tasks" and expand: esp32dev -> Platform
- Select "Build Filesystem Image" first
- Then connect the clock in download mode
- Click "Upload Filesystem Image"

![alt text](/documentation/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildFilesystem.png)

This will upload the files to the SPIFFS filesystem on the ESP32 (flash of the clock).

Note: The data will stay there, even if you re-upload the real firmware to the app partition, because the data partition is not overriden or modified by that.

### 5.4.3 Check if clock is working

After Step 2 the clock should boot up and show the boot sequence on all displays.
After finishing the boot sequence, the clock should display the actual time with the default clock face.

## 5.5 Create a flashable firmware image

Alternatively to build and uploading the app part and the data part in single steps, you can create a single firmware file, which is flashable all at once to the clock.

You still need to define all the settings/features you want to use in the `USER_DEFINES.h`, especially your clock type.

Additionally, you need to uncomment the line `-D CREATE_FIRMWAREFILE` in the platformio.ini to enable a post-build step, to create the image for your clock.

If you now build the project in PlatformIO via the "Build" command, the normal build will takes place and afterwards, a helper script will call the build for the SPIFFS data partition and then merge the existing single files together to one file.

The output file is written to the default output dir of the build. Usually the subfolder `.pio\build\esp32dev\` in the project folder.

The firmware file will be named like `<CLOCKNAME>_combined.bin` (e.g. Elekstube_CLOCK_Gen2_combined.bin).

This file can be flashed with the `esptool.exe` with the `write_flash` option.

E.g. assuming you are using the `esptool.exe` in the pre-build-firmware folder:

```esptool.exe --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash 0x0000 ..\EleksTubeHAX_pio\.pio\build\esp32dev\Elekstube_CLOCK_Gen2_combined.bin --erase-all```

### 5.5.1 Helper script

The supplied `script_build_fs_and_merge.py` automatically hangs in two more post-build steps to the build process of PlatformIO (PIO).

The first one executes PlatformIO with the build target `buildfs` (equivalent to the option "Build Filesystem Image" in the PIO GUI) by calling PIO directly from Python. The file `spiffs.bin` with the data partition is created in the PIO build target directory.

The second one checks if all necessary files are present and then reads the used partition table file for this PIO environment to get the right offsets for merging the files togehter.

It then uses the `esptool.py` with the option `merge_bin` to merge the binary files together.

## 5.6 Miscellaneous stuff

### 5.6.1 Custom clock faces from Bitmaps

If you want to change the uploaded clock faces for the clock:

- Create your own set of BMP files or select and copy some from the provided sets in the `data - other graphics` folder of this repo or download some from the internet (see below).
- Maximum resolution of each image is 135 x 240 pixels (HxW). They can be smaller, then the picture will be centered on the display.
- Maximum color depth is 24 bit RGB. But recommended is palettized Bitmaps with 256 colors palette.
- Name them `10.bmp` (for digit Zero) through `19.bmp` (for digit Nine); `20.bmp` to `29.bmp`, and so on. Note: There is no set 00-09.bmp!
- You can add max 8 clock face sets in the moment (Due to a problem in the detection meachanism).
- If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` directory.
- Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.

Tips:

- Cut away any black border, this only eats away valuable flash storage space! Keep the same height for all images!
- Run your preferred image editor and play with reduced bit depths / palettization and dither of the image!
- Very good results are with Dithering and 256-color palette. Size reduction is approx 70%.
- With very simple images (like 7-segment digits) even 16-color (4-bit) palette is enough and reduces size even further.

### 5.6.2 CLK files as alternative

Before supporting palettized Bitmaps, there was a special format used to store images, to safe some space on the flash of the clock. You can still switch to use CLK (Clock) files only, but there is no space saving anymore, if palattized Bitmaps are used!

To convert existing image files to CLK format:

- Run the tool `\Prepare_images\Convert_BMP_to_CLK.exe` (Windows only)
- You can select all BMP files to be converted at once. It will create CLK files from it.
- For a 24 bit depth Bitmap, size reduction is approx 30%.
- If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` directory.
- Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.

Note: It is either Bitmap or CLK! No mixing, so make sure to "clean" the `data` folder before switching.

#### 5.6.3 Download Clock faces

Here are links to some good 3rd party sets out there:

- <https://github.com/upiir/ips_clock_100x_themes>
- <https://github.com/upiir/elekstube_ips_custom_theme>
- <https://github.com/upiir/rgb_glow_tube_clock>

If you have your own clock face that'll work and want it listed here, please file an Issue and/or Pull Request.

#### 5.6.4 Configure your WiFi network

- For WPS: When prompted by the clock, press WPS button on your router (or in web-interface of your router). Clock will automatically connect to the WiFi and save data for future use. No need to input your credentials anywhere in the source code. The clock will remember WiFi connection details even if you unplug the clock.
- Without WPS: Add your WiFi credentials into `_USER_DEFINES.h` file before building the firmware.

Note: The `_USER_DEFINES.h` is included in the default `.gitignore` file, so that your personal credentials will not be pushed to a git repo by default, if you are using a forked git repo.

### 5.6.5 MQTT and Home Assistant

#### 5.6.5.1 Home Assistant

##### 5.6.5.1.1 Setup

If you want to integrate the clock into your Home Assistant, you need to make sure, that Home Assistant and the clock uses the same MQTT broker.

Normally you will already have a MQTT broker running locally, which supports the HA discovery and communication messages, like Mosquitto.
If not done already, you can set it up easily via an Add-On in HA.
See: [Home Assistant MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/)

You can also use an internet-based broker which supports "Home Assistant messages" (topics) for discovery and communication, like HiveMQ.

If you set up the broker, you first need to enter the used IP, port, username and password of it into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section). You have to define `MQTT_ENABLED` as well.

As second step you have to enable the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` define to have general HA support and the beloning `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT_*` defines for auto discorvery via the MQTT integration.

After flashing the firmware, the clock will first try connect to the WiFi and then to the given MQTT broker. Check the displays, if a 'NO MQTT' message appears under one of the digits, then the connection was NOT successful and you need to debug why.

If the connection was successfull the clock sends the discovery messages for HA and the device should be vissible in the MQTT integration.

Note: If you change your used clock faces in the data folder, the `clockfaces.txt` in the `data` folder needs to be changed too. This is, because the shown names in HA for the clock faces under "Main light" are hard coded and read from there.

Note: `#define MQTT_CLIENT` is used as a unique device name (i.e. it should be different if you have several IPS clocks) and is the "root" part of the topic for all entities that will be interacted with via MQTT.

Note: If you want to use an internet-based broker, you can use HiveMQ. You will need to create an account there and set it up in HA and in here. 'MQTT_USE_TLS' must be defined, because HiveMQ only supports encrypted connections. The HiveMQ TLS cert is based on the root CA of Let's Encrypt, so you also need to copy the 'mqtt-ca-root.pem' file from the 'data - other graphics' folder into the 'data' folder of the PIO project and upload the data partiton (file system) with the changed app partition. Other brokers or your localy used cert for your MQTT broker may need another root CA to be set.
See: [Connect HA to HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/)

##### 5.6.4.1.2 Used integrations

Interactions between the firmware of the clock and Home Assistant is done like descriped in the MQTT integration documentations (see below).

If using the default auto discovery, the clock and all its entities will be found by the MQTT integration without user intervention.

The clock is discoverd as two lights (Main and Back) and some other entities (i.e. a switch) as Configuration. The last one is needed to be able to switch the settings of the clock.

See the HA MQTT documentation for details of the used MQTT integrations:

Note: It is preferable (but not mandatory) to use MQTT Discovery (Active, if `#define MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT_DISCOVERY` and the following define statements are uncomment).
Otherwise, all settings will need to be done manually!

##### 5.6.4.1.3 Usage

After a successful auto discovery, you will find a new device under "Setting -> Devices and Services -> MQTT -> XX devices", named like your `MQTT_CLIENT` define.

![HA MQTT Integration Overview](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationOverview.png)

If you go into the device details it should look like this:

![HA MQTT Integration Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationDetails.png)

You can now use this device on your HA dashboards.

The main light represents the displays of the clock, the back light the LED ambient lights.

Each one is dimmable, can be turned on and off and for the 'main light', the clock faces are switchable via "Effect".

![HA MQTT Main Light Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTMainLightDetails.png)

For the 'back light', the LED colour and mode can be set.

![HA MQTT Back Light Details](/documentation/ImagesMD/HAMQTTBackLightDetails.png)

The settings for the LED modes and the general clock settings can only be set from the "Configuration" entity.

#### 5.6.5.2 MQTT without Home Assistant

##### 5.6.5.2.1 Setup

If the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` define is NOT enabled, just `MQTT_ENABLED`, the MQTT support is very limited in the moment!

You can still use MQTT to control the clock, but only via direct MQTT messages, sent from a MQTT client (like MQTT Explorer or similar or from a WebUI/API of the internet-based broker).

The actual "pure" MQTT implementation is reacting to control commands of an "emulated" temperature sensor, so you can use i.e. "\<CLIENTID\>/set/temperature" topic as a command to control the clock.

This is a workaround to have at least a basic MQTT support and to work with the smartnest broker service (which only support limited device types).

For pure MQTT support you can either use any internet-based MQTT broker (i.e. smartnest.cz or HiveMQ) or a local one (i.e. Mosquitto).

If you choose an internet based one, you will need to create an account, (maybe setting up the device there and get the ID) and fill in the data into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section).

If you choose a local one, you will need to set up the broker on your local network and do the same.

Note: If you want to use encrypted connection to your broker, you need to enable 'MQTT_USE_TLS' and copy a valid root CA cert file to the 'data' folder. See the notes under the HA section for HiveMQ above.

#### 5.6.5.3 Debugging MQTT

Further analysis or debugging problems with the MQTT code is easier to perform using a MQTT message reader tool, for example, "MQTT Explorer", a common HA Add-On for users, who prefer manual configuration.
See [HA forum post for MQTT Explorer Add-On](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739).

Note: It can be also used as a stand-alone application. See [Homepage of MQTT Explorer project](https://mqtt-explorer.com/).

You need to connect to the same MQTT broker like the clock and then will be able to see the messages from the clock and send them.

All MQTT messages from and to the clock are also traced out via the serial interface. So using a serial monitor while using the clock, gives also debug information.

## 6. Known problems/limitations

##### 6.1 No RTC for SI HAI IPS Clock

There is no battery on the SI HAI IPS clock, so the clock will loose the time, if powered off.

##### 6.2 Precision of the gesture sensor (NovelLife SE)

The accuracy of the gesture sensor on the Novellife clock is not very good. It needs some 'training' to be able to control the clock.

The defined gestures and there button equivalents are:

|  gesture | button |
|--|--|
| down, near | Power |
| up, far | Mode |
| left | Left |
| right | Right |

- The movement of the finger/hand from behind the glass tubes of the watch, over the glass tubes, directly and closely over the sensor to the front of the watch is the “down” gesture.
- The movement of the finger/hand from in front of the watch, directly and closely over the sensor, further over the glass tubes and behind it is the “up” gesture.
- The movement of the finger/hand starting left side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the right side is the “right” gesture.
- The movement of the finger/hand starting right side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the left side is the “left” gesture.
- Moving the finger/hand from directly above the sensor (from 5-8 cm away) toward the sensor (up to about 1 cm away) is the “near” gesture.
- Moving from close by the sensor (coming from the front and putting the finger/hand in 1cm distance over the sensor) to a bit more far away (5-7cm distance) is the "far" gesture.

## 8. Hardware modifications

#### 8.1 PunkCyber IPS clock: No CH340 chip soldered on PCB of newer editions

##### Problem

**Short story**: CH340 chip is missing.

**Long story**: The original version of the "PunkCyber IPS Clock" was buyable from PCBWay as "RGB Glow Tube DIY Clock" and is no longer available from there (see [PCBWay | RGB Glow Clock]('https://www.pcbway.com/project/gifts_detail/RGB_Glow_Tube_Clock_907ad35c.html')). This version had a CH340 chip soldered and two USB-C ports, where the right one was working, to communicate with a PC via the USB-UART chip.

The clock is still available to buy from other resellers. It is already assembled and in a box, sold as "PunkCyber IPS Clock".

All these newer versions of the clock do NOT have the CH340 chip and the components for the "auto download mode circuit" soldered! Just empty soldering header.
So both USB-C ports are only for giving power to the clock.

A communication (like downloading or uploading firmware) is not possible easily without this chip!

The original manufacturer has an 'interesting' way to update the firmware "over-the-air", by connecting your mobile phone to the Wifi-Access-Point of the clock and joining a WeChat channel and let them control the clock from there (see the discussion on the PCBWay site).

##### Solution

If you want to bring the EleksTubeHAX firmware to the clock, we need either to solder a CH340 chip and the transistors and resistors on there designated places, or use an "external" USB-UART bridge/board.

The "easiser" way is the external board solution IMO.

Below the missing chip are some soldering headers:

![PunkCyber / RGB Glow tube](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_header.jpg)

BOOT is connected to GPIO0 (pin 25) on the ESP32
EN is connected to EN (pin 3) on the ESP32
G is connected to Ground (pins 1/38/15) on the ESP32
R is connected to GPIO1 / TxD (pin 35) on the ESP32
T is connected to GPIO3 / RxD (pin 34) on the ESP32

So we just need to connect
G on the PCB to Ground on the UART bridge/board
R on the PCB to Rx on the UART bridge/board
T on the PCB to Tx on the UART bridge/board

| Pin PCB | Pin UART |
| ------ | ------ |
| G | GND |
| R | Rx |
| T | Tx |

We also need a way to put the clock into the download mode, so we need some kind of a switch between
left header of BOOT 1 (to ESP32) and
right header of BOOT 1 (Ground).

Best way is to solder "sockets" to the existing headers, so that there longer pin side is pointing downwards from the not printed side of the PCB. Reason is easy, there is enough space between the backplate and the PCB to leave them soldered on for re-usage and they are not visible from the upper side.

Soldered sockets:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets.jpg)

Soldered sockets with backplate:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets_with_backplate.jpg)

BOOT needs to be shorted, while the USB-C cable is connected to one of the USB-C ports (while powering) and then released to go into the download mode.

Normally, all USB-UART bridges/boards should work, but for me, the UART bridge mode of the Flipper Zero (STM chip) didn't work properly! I have no idea why.

So I successfully used an old FT232 board, which was still flying around (with Mini-USB :)) to read/backup the orginal firmware and write the EleksTubeHAX version.

To get one on your own, search for "USB to UART" on your favorite seller platform, like the ones with A from US or PRC. Costs should not exceed 2-7 EUR/USD.

Working solution:

![PunkCyber connected via FT232](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_connected_UART-USB_bridge_and_reset_button.jpg)

Successful backup:

![PunkCyber successfull backup](/documentation/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_backup_successful.jpg)

Thanks to @Fastdruid for finding a good way to overcome this problem! (see [Issue 62]('https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/EleksTubeHAX/issues/62'))

#### 8.2 EleksTube Gen1: 5V on CH340 and ESP32

##### Problem

The "Original Version" (Gen1) of the Elekstube clock has a few issues in the hardware design. Most notably, it forces 5V signals from the USB-UART chip into the ESP32, which is not happy about it. This is outside of the safe operating limits and significantly reduces the lifetime of the ESP32. Mine (from the original author) died because of this...

##### Solution

The CH340 chip, used for USB-UART conversion, can operate both on 5V and 3.3V. On the Gen1 board it is powered by 5V.
We can switch it to 3.3V.
Cut one trace on the bottom side of the board that supplies the chip with 5V and route the 3.3V over the resistors / capacitors to VDD and VREF of the CH340.

![EleksStube Gen1 hardware modification](/documentation/ImagesMD/EleksTube_IPS_CH340C_mod.jpg)

Note: This problem does not appear on Gen2 hardware from Elekstube! All clocks sold today (Autumn 2024) do not require any hardware modification!
